=====

This is a **K**han **A**cademy **Gen**erator tool used for creating [Khan Academy Serbian](http://khanacademy.rs) site. It uses MongoDB for storage. Data is retrieved via multiple publicly accessible APIs, such as the ones of Amara, Khan Academy, YouTube and Google Docs. Generated site is _i18n_ enabled, main goal being the support for both scripts used in Serbian - Latin and Cyrillic. Translations texts are available via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/kagen) service.
